currently working ~on~ at: AMD

internship schedule has left me with little time to catch up on contributions and personal projects. getting to work on gfx drivers is so incredibly fun though


projects backed up:
- [altostratus](https://github.com/AnarchistHoneybun/altostratus)
- [painterz](https://github.com/AnarchistHoneybun/painterz)
